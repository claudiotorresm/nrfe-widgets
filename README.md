Widgets for the Node-RED front end to Evothings.

A description of the project is available in the article [All tomorrows lines of code
](http://unclescript.blogspot.se/2015/12/all-tomorrows-lines-of-code.html), which reads in part:

> I've extended the open-source IoT web-app development tool Evothings Studio by slapping on the open-source node-red flow-based editor and a number of custom modules to let you generate mobile web-apps with little or no coding, that let you connect to and communicate with Bluetooth devices.
